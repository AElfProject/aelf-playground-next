# Expense Tracker

**Description**: The Expense Tracker dApp is a decentralized application that enables users to manage and monitor their personal finances on the aelf blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for recording expenses, categorizing them, and tracking spending habits, with all data securely stored and verified on the aelf blockchain.

**Purpose**: The purpose of the Expense Tracker dApp is to showcase the integration of personal finance management with blockchain technology, offering enhanced transparency and security for users' financial data. It serves as a practical example of decentralized applications in everyday use cases, while also providing a learning platform for smart contract development and blockchain-based financial solutions.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate

## Step 1 - Develop Smart Contract

### Adding Your Smart Contract Code

First, generate the template: <GenerateTemplate name="ExpenseTracker" renameHelloWorldProto="expense_tracker" />.

Now that we have a template expense tracker project, we can customise the template to incorporate our own contract logic.
Let's start by implementing methods to handle the basic functionality of AddExpense, UpdateExpense, DeleteExpense, ListExpenses, and GetExpense and GetInitialStatus as complete within the contract state.

#### Defining Methods and Messages

The implementation of `expense_tracker.proto` file inside folder `src/Protobuf/contract/` is as follows:

```csharp title="expense_tracker.proto"
syntax = "proto3";
import "aelf/options.proto";
import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";
import "google/protobuf/wrappers.proto";
import "Protobuf/reference/acs12.proto";
// The namespace of this class
option csharp_namespace = "AElf.Contracts.ExpenseTracker";
service ExpenseTracker {
  option (aelf.csharp_state) = "AElf.Contracts.ExpenseTracker.ExpenseTrackerState";
  option (aelf.base) = "Protobuf/reference/acs12.proto";
  rpc Initialize (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }
  rpc AddExpense (ExpenseInput) returns (google.protobuf.StringValue) {
  }
  rpc UpdateExpense (ExpenseUpdateInput) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }
  rpc DeleteExpense (google.protobuf.StringValue) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }
  rpc ListExpenses (google.protobuf.StringValue) returns (ExpenseList) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }
  rpc GetExpense (google.protobuf.StringValue) returns (Expense) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }
  rpc GetInitialStatus (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.BoolValue) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }
}

message Expense {
  string expense_id = 1;
  string description = 2;
  string category = 3;
  int64 amount = 4; // Store as cents
  string currency = 5;
  string owner = 6;
  int64 created_at = 7;
  int64 updated_at = 8;
}

message ExpenseInput {
  string description = 1;
  string category = 2;
  int64 amount = 3; // Store as cents
  string currency = 4;
}

message ExpenseUpdateInput {
  string expense_id = 1;
  string description = 2;
  string category = 3;
  int64 amount = 4; // Store as cents
  string currency = 5;
}

message ExpenseList {
  repeated Expense expenses = 1;
}
```

- `rpc` methods define the callable functions within the contract, allowing external systems to interact with the contract's logic.
- `message` represent the structured data exchanged between the contract and external systems.

#### Define Contract States

The implementation of the Expense Tracker smart contract state inside file `src/ExpenseTrackerState.cs` is as follows:

```csharp title="src/ExpenseTrackerState.cs"
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp.State;
using AElf.Types;

namespace AElf.Contracts.ExpenseTracker
{
    public class ExpenseTrackerState : ContractState
    {
        public BoolState Initialized { get; set; }
        public SingletonState<Address> Owner { get; set; }
        public MappedState<string, Expense> Expenses { get; set; } // Mapping of expense ID to Expense
        public MappedState<string, bool> ExpenseExistence { get; set; } // Mapping to track expense existence
        public StringState ExpenseIds { get; set; } // Concatenated string of expense IDs
        public Int32State ExpenseCounter { get; set; } // Counter for generating unique IDs
    }
}
```

- The `State.cs` file in an aelf blockchain smart contract holds the variables that store the contract's data, making sure this data is saved and accessible whenever the contract needs it.

#### Implement Expense Tracker Smart Contract

The implementation of the Expense Tracker smart contract inside file `src/ExpenseTracker.cs` is as follows:

```csharp title="src/ExpenseTracker.cs"
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace AElf.Contracts.ExpenseTracker
{
    public class ExpenseTracker : ExpenseTrackerContainer.ExpenseTrackerBase
    {
        public override Empty Initialize(Empty input)
        {
            if (State.Initialized.Value)
            {
                return new Empty();
            }
            State.Initialized.Value = true;
            State.Owner.Value = Context.Sender;
            State.ExpenseIds.Value = "";
            State.ExpenseCounter.Value = 0;
            return new Empty();
        }

        public override StringValue AddExpense(ExpenseInput input)
        {
            if (!State.Initialized.Value)
            {
                return new StringValue { Value = "Contract not initialized." };
            }
            var expenseId = (State.ExpenseCounter.Value + 1).ToString();
            State.ExpenseCounter.Value++;
            var timestamp = Context.CurrentBlockTime.Seconds;
            State.Expenses[expenseId] = new Expense
            {
                ExpenseId = expenseId,
                Description = input.Description,
                Category = input.Category,
                Amount = input.Amount, // Now using int64 for amount
                Currency = input.Currency,
                CreatedAt = timestamp,
                UpdatedAt = timestamp,
                Owner = Context.Sender.ToString().Trim('"'),
            };
            State.ExpenseExistence[expenseId] = true;

            var existingExpenseIds = State.ExpenseIds.Value;
            existingExpenseIds += string.IsNullOrEmpty(existingExpenseIds) ? expenseId : $",{expenseId}";
            State.ExpenseIds.Value = existingExpenseIds;

            return new StringValue { Value = expenseId };
        }

        public override Empty UpdateExpense(ExpenseUpdateInput input)
        {
            var expense = State.Expenses[input.ExpenseId];
            if (expense == null)
            {
                return new Empty(); // Handle case if expense doesn't exist
            }
            expense.Description = input.Description ?? expense.Description;
            expense.Category = input.Category ?? expense.Category;
            expense.Amount = input.Amount != 0 ? input.Amount : expense.Amount; // Now using int64 for amount
            expense.Currency = input.Currency ?? expense.Currency;
            expense.UpdatedAt = Context.CurrentBlockTime.Seconds;

            State.Expenses[input.ExpenseId] = expense;
            return new Empty();
        }

        public override Empty DeleteExpense(StringValue input)
        {
            State.Expenses.Remove(input.Value);
            State.ExpenseExistence.Remove(input.Value);

            var existingExpenseIds = State.ExpenseIds.Value.Split(',');
            var newExpenseIds = new List<string>(existingExpenseIds.Length);
            foreach (var expenseId in existingExpenseIds)
            {
                if (expenseId != input.Value)
                {
                    newExpenseIds.Add(expenseId);
                }
            }
            State.ExpenseIds.Value = string.Join(",", newExpenseIds);

            return new Empty();
        }

        public override ExpenseList ListExpenses(StringValue input)
        {
            var owner = input.Value; // Get the owner value from the input
            var expenseList = new ExpenseList();
            var expenseIds = State.ExpenseIds.Value.Split(',');

                var expense = State.Expenses[expenseId];
                if (expense != null && expense.Owner == owner) // Filter expenses by owner
                {
                    expenseList.Expenses.Add(expense);
                }
