# Lottery Game Contract

**Description**: This contract is moderately complex. It demonstrates the use of
state variables, user interactions, and random number generation to create a
basic lottery game.

**Purpose**: To introduce you to more advanced concepts such as state
management, event handling, and randomization in smart contracts.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate

## Step 1 - Develop Smart Contract

### Adding Your Smart Contract Code

First, generate the template: <GenerateTemplate name="LotteryGame" template="aelf-lottery" />.

Now that we have a template lottery game project, we can customise the template to incorporate our own contract logic.
Lets start by implementing methods to provide basic functionality for updating and reading a message stored persistently in the contract state.

#### Defining Methods and Messages

The implementation of file `src/Protobuf/contract/lottery_game_contract.proto` is as follows:

```csharp title="lottery_game_contract.proto"
syntax = "proto3";

import "aelf/core.proto";
import "aelf/options.proto";
import "google/protobuf/empty.proto";
import "google/protobuf/wrappers.proto";
import "Protobuf/reference/acs12.proto";
// The namespace of this class
option csharp_namespace = "AElf.Contracts.LotteryGame";

service LotteryGame {
  // The name of the state class the smart contract is going to use to access blockchain state
  option (aelf.csharp_state) = "AElf.Contracts.LotteryGame.LotteryGameState";
  option (aelf.base) = "Protobuf/reference/acs12.proto";

  rpc Initialize (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }

  rpc Play (google.protobuf.Int64Value) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }

  rpc Withdraw (google.protobuf.Int64Value) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }

  rpc Deposit (google.protobuf.Int64Value) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }

  rpc TransferOwnership (aelf.Address) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
  }

  rpc GetPlayAmountLimit (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (PlayAmountLimitMessage) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }

  rpc GetContractBalance (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Int64Value) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }

  rpc GetOwner (google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.StringValue) {
    option (aelf.is_view) = true;
  }
}

// An event that will be emitted from contract method call when Play is called.
message PlayOutcomeEvent {
  option (aelf.is_event) = true;
  int64 amount = 1;
  int64 won = 2;
}

// An event that will be emitted from contract method call when Withdraw is called.
message WithdrawEvent {
  option (aelf.is_event) = true;
  int64 amount = 1;
  aelf.Address from = 2;
  aelf.Address to = 3;
}

// An event that will be emitted from contract method call when Deposit is called.
message DepositEvent {
  option (aelf.is_event) = true;
  int64 amount = 1;
  aelf.Address from = 2;
  aelf.Address to = 3;
}

// The message containing the play amount limits
message PlayAmountLimitMessage {
  int64 minimumAmount = 1;
  int64 maximumAmount = 2;
}
```

#### Define Contract States

The implementation of file `src/LotteryGameState.cs` is as follows:

```csharp title="src/LotteryGameState.cs"
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp.State;
using AElf.Types;

namespace AElf.Contracts.LotteryGame
{
    // The state class is access the blockchain state
    public partial class LotteryGameState : ContractState
    {
        // A state to check if contract is initialized
        public BoolState Initialized { get; set; }
        // A state to store the owner address
        public SingletonState<Address> Owner { get; set; }
    }
}
```

#### Contract Reference State

- Navigate to `src`. 

- create a **new file** `ContractReferences.cs`.

The implementation of file `src/ContractRefefrence.cs` is as follows:

```csharp title="ContractReferences.cs"
using AElf.Contracts.MultiToken;

namespace AElf.Contracts.LotteryGame
{
    public partial class LotteryGameState
    {
        internal TokenContractContainer.TokenContractReferenceState TokenContract { get; set; }
    }
}
```

#### Implement Lottery Game Smart Contract

- Navigate to `src/LotteryGame.cs`

```csharp title="LotteryGame.cs"
using AElf.Contracts.MultiToken;
using AElf.Sdk.CSharp;
using AElf.Types;
using Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes;

namespace AElf.Contracts.LotteryGame
{
    // Contract class must inherit the base class generated from the proto file
    public class LotteryGame : LotteryGameContainer.LotteryGameBase
    {
        private const string TokenContractAddress = "ASh2Wt7nSEmYqnGxPPzp4pnVDU4uhj1XW9Se5VeZcX2UDdyjx"; // tDVW token contract address
        private const string TokenSymbol = "ELF";
        private const long MinimumPlayAmount = 1_000_000; // 0.01 ELF
        private const long MaximumPlayAmount = 1_000_000_000; // 10 ELF

        // Initializes the contract
        public override Empty Initialize(Empty input)
        {
            // Check if the contract is already initialized
            Assert(State.Initialized.Value == false, "Already initialized.");
            // Set the contract state
            State.Initialized.Value = true;
            // Set the owner address
            State.Owner.Value = Context.Sender;

            // Initialize the token contract
            State.TokenContract.Value = Address.FromBase58(TokenContractAddress);

            return new Empty();
        }

        // Plays the lottery game with a specified amount of tokens.
        // The method checks if the play amount is within the limit.
        // If the player wins, tokens are transferred from the contract to the sender and a PlayOutcomeEvent is fired with the won amount.
        // If the player loses, tokens are transferred from the sender to the contract and a PlayOutcomeEvent is fired with the lost amount.
        public override Empty Play(Int64Value input)
        {
            var playAmount = input.Value;

            // Check if input amount is within the limit
            Assert(playAmount is >= MinimumPlayAmount and <= MaximumPlayAmount, "Invalid play amount.");

            // Check if the sender has enough tokens
            var balance = State.TokenContract.GetBalance.Call(new GetBalanceInput
            {
                Owner = Context.Sender,
                Symbol = TokenSymbol
            }).Balance;
            Assert(balance >= playAmount, "Insufficient balance.");

            // Check if the contract has enough tokens
            var contractBalance = State.TokenContract.GetBalance.Call(new GetBalanceInput
            {
                Owner = Context.Self,
                Symbol = TokenSymbol

            Assert(contractBalance >= playAmount, "Insufficient contract balance.");

            if(IsWinner())
            {
