## Getting Started

First, build the development container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the services.

```bash
docker compose up --watch
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

If the page stops auto-updating, refresh the browser to fix it.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
