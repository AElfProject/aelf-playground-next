# Hello World Contract

**Description**: This is the simplest contract to get you started. It introduces the
basic structure of a smart contract and shows how to deploy and interact with
it.

**Purpose**: To familiarize you with the basic syntax and deployment process of
smart contracts on aelf blockchain.

**Difficulty Level**: Easy

## Step 1 - Adding Your Smart Contract Code

First, generate the template: <GenerateTemplateSolidity />.

We'll start by creating methods to update and read a message stored in the contract.

The implementation of file `src/HelloWorld.sol` is as follows:

```solidity title="src/HelloWorld.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// compiler version must be greater than or equal to 0.8.24 and less than 0.9.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greet = "Hello World!";
}
```

## Step 2 - Building Smart Contract

Build the new code by clicking the Build button.

## Step 3 - Deploy Smart Contract

Deploy the new code by clicking the Deploy button.
